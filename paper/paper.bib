    abstract = {We describe the main features of tabu search, emphasizing a perspective for guiding a user to understand basic implementation principles for solving combinatorial or nonlinear problems. We also identify recent developments and extensions that have contributed to increasing the efficiency of the method. One of the useful aspects of tabu search is the ability to adapt a rudimentary prototype implementation to encompass additional model elements, such as new types of constraints and objective functions. Similarly, the method itself can be evolved to varying levels of sophistication. We provide several examples of discrete optimization problems to illustrate the strategic concerns of tabu search, and to show how they may be exploited in various contexts. Our presentation is motivated by the emergence of an extensive literature of computational results, which demonstrates that a well-tuned implementation makes it possible to obtain solutions of high quality for difficult problems, yielding outcomes in some settings that have not been matched by other known techniques.},

    abstract = {This paper addresses the joint train-scheduling and demand-flow problem for a major US freight railroad. No efficient optimization techniques are known to solve the NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Genetic search is used to find acceptable solutions; however, its performance is found to deteriorate as the problem size grows. A "tabu-enhanced" genetic search algorithm is proposed to improve the genetic search performance. The searches are applied to test problems with known optima to gauge them for solution speed and nearness to optimality. The tabu-enhanced genetic search is found to take on average only 6{\%} of the iterations required by genetic search, consistently achieves better approximations to the optimum and maintains its performance as the problem size grows. The tabu-enhanced search is then applied to the full-scale operating plan problem. Model results reveal a potential for 4{\%} cost savings over the current railroad operating plan coupled with a 6{\%} reduction in late service.},
